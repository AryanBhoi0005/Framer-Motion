=>If any rendering issue in animation always inspect 
=>Whenever we install any library like next react or framer gitLibrary is 
  already installed so while creating repo ignore first 2 commands 

->First Install Framer-motion Library 
->Choose the div tag in which you want to add 
  animation effects
->Add motion.div it works with anything 
  a , img, div 
->We have to add animate prop effects which takes in the key value pair or also 
  a String
->Add style prop effects and Add transition prop effects speed
->"tween" effect is just straightforward 
   no real life physics effect
->"spring" is a type of animation and with it we can't use duration we use 
  "stiffness" instead for amount of recoil 
->"damping" to slow down 
   stiffness
->animate,initial,transition 
  are the 3 main props 


*********************************
Events and Dragging Effects
->Click or Hover event 
->Click and hold and drag and move event

->"whileDrag" event is a prop which is already present in framer motion so we 
   don't have to use css hover effect 
->"while" prop
->"drag" event is a prop which helps to drag a component anywhere on screen and 
   for that effect just add "drag"
->"x" to only drag in x axis or only in y axis 
->dragConstraint can take upto 4 values (r,l,t,b) like to prvent drag out of    
  the screen 

**************************************
Variants [BOX4]
-> Other than writing code evrytime we can create a function and call it in form 
   of variants 
->Everytime we have to determine a animate and intital state so better than that 
   we create various variants of something and then call it by their variant name 
->We can create key value pairs where key is any random name and value is the 
  styling value 

 ->const Boxvariants is a  list of variant names which are arbitary  
 ->then call the variant list and animate the respective vaiant

 ->We can create a "delay" event like a async function
 ->As now we want to animate the child boxes we have to add <motion.li>
 ->As we add motion to child boxes it also carries the properties metioned in 
   the parent container or 
    [variants={boxVariant}
    animate="visible"
    initial="hidden]
->For child use which variant is the child using 
->The props we have defined in the parent container directly is called by the 
  children
->The child is using the properties of parent which is already defined in the 
  parent container so we only need to call the different variant
->When we remove delay from children we use "when"
            when:"beforeChildren"
  So now it loads after parent 
-> Staggered children refers to animating multiple child elements in a sequence 
   with a slight delay between each element's animation.

********************************************
KeyFrames 
->[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] values present in array form are 
   key frames which define the animation frames  
->Everything depends upon duration of how long do we need 
  that animation to occur 

*********************************************
Framer Motion Hook [useAnimation]
->Using the hook we are calling an Callback function 
  whcih perform certain animations on basis of props
->On every button click its starting another animation and
  ending the other ones
  ->control is a variable name with 
    1.control.start to start animation
    2.control.stop to end animation
  ->Main task to run animate inside motion hook
